CACHE MANIFEST

CACHE:

# This section below gets the offline mode working as expected. Everything that is needed is cached, 
# including the CSS and Javascript and JS continues to execute as expected. If we dont list the files
# to be cached here, they get cached once visited however to get a truly offline experience, we should
# pro-actively cache them by explicitly specifiying them.

# Note: This section below sort of works, however when the browser wants one of these resources,
# it seems to only get a cache hit if the URL of the resource it was going to get is explicitly
# listed as per the above section. So the section below seems to cache the pages, but not the CSS
# or the Javascript
