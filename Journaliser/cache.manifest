CACHE MANIFEST

#Journaliser manifest file

# This section below gets the offline mode working as expected. Everything that is needed is cached, 
# including the CSS and Javascript and JS continues to execute as expected. If we dont list the files
# to be cached here, they get cached once visited however to get a truly offline experience, we should
# pro-actively cache them by explicitly specifiying them.
